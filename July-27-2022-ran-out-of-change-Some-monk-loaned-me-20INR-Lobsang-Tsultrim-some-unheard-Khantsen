So I needed to go to Koppa and realized at Bus stop didn't have any small change 10Inr for bus fare, however I got
bailed out by a Kind young monk.  He loaned me 20INR for back n forth and am forever grateful to him for his help.

The day was cloudy yet partly sunny & beautiful and bus ride was short & pleasant. Caught some local scenes along the way.
I think I've exhausted the places to eat in nearby towns. 

Fare from Camp to Koppa 10INR. Sweets 5INR each, JIO 57 DAYS 490INR
